This is tictactoe, my first acutal project as a coder, Ultimately it took about 2 hours. It was more of a proof of concept and a fun
little challenge. Overall a super positive experience. Weirdly enough most of the logic proved easier than I expected. I do hope to come
back to this in the future and see if I can improve it further.
